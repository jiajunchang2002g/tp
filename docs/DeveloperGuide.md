### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores CrimeWatch's data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CrimeWatch data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add command

#### Command format

The current `add` command format is:

`add n/NAME a/ADDRESS s/STAGE [al/ALIAS(,ALIAS...)] [note/NOTES] [r/RISK] [t/TAG]...`

Required fields:
- `n/` name
- `a/` address
- `s/` stage

Optional fields:
- `al/` aliases (comma-separated)
- `note/` notes
- `r/` risk (defaults to `medium`)
- `t/` tags (repeatable)

#### Parsing flow

`AddCommandParser` tokenizes by all supported prefixes, validates required prefixes, checks duplicate single-value prefixes, then builds a `Person`.

Implementation references:
- parser: [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java)
- command: [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java)

Key parser behavior:
- Rejects missing required prefixes with `MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT`.
- Uses `verifyNoDuplicatePrefixesFor(...)` for `n/`, `a/`, `al/`, `note/`, `r/`, `s/`.
- Parses aliases via `ParserUtil.parseAliases(...)`; empty alias payload is rejected.
- Applies default risk via `Risk.getDefault()` when `r/` is omitted.
- Parses tags from all `t/` occurrences into a `Set<Tag>`.

#### Field constraints

Validation is enforced in model/value objects and parser utilities:
- `Name`: alphanumeric + spaces, non-blank.
- `Alias`: trimmed, 1-50 chars, alphanumeric + spaces.
- `Stage`: one of `surveillance`, `approached`, `cooperating`, `arrested`, `closed`.
- `Notes`: optional text, max 500 chars, no newlines.
- `Risk`: one of `low`, `medium`, `high` (case-insensitive parser).
- `Tag`: alphanumeric.

Relevant classes:
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ParserUtil.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ParserUtil.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Name.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Name.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Alias.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Alias.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Stage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Stage.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Notes.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Notes.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Risk.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Risk.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/tag/Tag.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/tag/Tag.java)
### Sort feature

#### Overview

The `sort` feature reorders the currently displayed contact list by a selected criterion:
- `location`
- `tag`
- `alphabetical`
- `status`
- `recent`

This is implemented as a **view-level sort**. It does not mutate persisted `AddressBook` ordering in storage.

#### Command flow

1. User enters `sort CRITERION`.
2. `AddressBookParser` routes the command word `sort` to `SortCommandParser`.
3. `SortCommandParser` validates that there is exactly one token and maps it to `SortCriterion`.
4. `SortCommand#execute(Model)` calls `model.setPersonSortComparator(...)` with the criterion comparator.
5. UI updates automatically because it is bound to `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

Key classes:
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParser.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParser.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java)

#### Model integration

Sorting support is added to the `Model` API:
- `setPersonSortComparator(Comparator<Person>)`
- `clearPersonSortComparator()`

`ModelManager` now keeps:
- `FilteredList<Person> filteredPersons` for filtering
- `SortedList<Person> sortedPersons` wrapping `filteredPersons` for sorting

`getFilteredPersonList()` returns `sortedPersons`, so existing UI wiring works without extra UI changes.

Key classes:
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
- [`src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java)

#### Comparator behavior

Implemented in `SortCommand.SortCriterion`:
- `alphabetical`: by `Person#getName()`
- `status`: by `Person#getStage().toString()`, then by name
- `tag`: by alphabetically smallest tag name, nulls last, then by name
- `location`: by latest encounter location, normalized (trim + collapse spaces), nulls last, then by name
- `recent`: by latest encounter datetime descending (most recent first), then by name

For contacts with missing values (e.g., no encounters/no tags), comparators use `nullsLast(...)` so they appear at the end for those criteria.

#### Defensive parsing and validation

`SortCommandParser` rejects:
- missing criterion
- multiple tokens
- unsupported criterion

All invalid forms throw `ParseException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT` and command usage.

#### Tests

Parser tests:
- [`src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParserTest.java`](../src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParserTest.java)
- registration coverage in [`src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java`](../src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java)

Command/model integration tests:
- [`src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommandTest.java`](../src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommandTest.java)

Compatibility updates:
- `Model` test stubs implement the new methods, e.g. in [`src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommandTest.java`](../src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommandTest.java)

### Password Feature

### Overview
Optional, contact-level password protection. Each contact can be protected with a password to restrict viewing its full details.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Per-contact (individual contacts can be protected) |
| **Type** | Optional (contacts don't require passwords) |
| **Usage** | Add `pw/PASSWORD` to `add` or `edit` commands to protect; provide it with `view` to access |
| **Validation** | Alphanumeric characters and spaces only |

### Usage

```bash
# Add contact with password protection
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/john@example.com a/123 Main St s/suspect pw/password123

# Update/remove password
edit 1 pw/newpassword   # Change password
edit 1 pw/              # Remove protection

# View protected contact
view 1 pw/password123   # Show full details if password correct
view 1                  # Error: password required
```

### Behavior
- **Without password**: Contact viewable normally
- **With password**: `view` command requires correct password to display full details
- **Plain text**: Passwords stored without encryption (not production-ready)


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CrimeWatch data.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* an undercover law enforcement officer managing a network of suspects, informants, and persons of interest
* needs to create and update contact profiles quickly and discreetly
* requires fast retrieval of contact details under operational time pressure
* needs to track the investigation stage of each contact
* needs to log field encounters and observations tied to specific contacts
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: enable undercover officers to manage contact profiles, track investigation stages, and log field encounters faster and more discreetly than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app
